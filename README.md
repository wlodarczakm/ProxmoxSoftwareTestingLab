# ProxmoxSoftwareTestingLab
The project aims to showcase the capabilities of Proxmox as a tool for creating your own local environment where you can refine, elevate, and expand your skills in software testing

## Introduction to Proxmox

As Wikipedia says: 
>Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE or PVE) is a virtualisation platform designed for the provisioning of hyper-converged infrastructure.

For all information about Proxmox, please visit the official [Github](https://github.com/proxmox) and the website [www.proxmox.com.](https://www.proxmox.com/)

In the described projects, I use Proxmox 8.x.
